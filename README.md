	<li>Two drones are under control</li>
	<li>There is a base in the center</li>
	<li>The borders are the dots(hubs) around the base, each dot is at some distance from another</li>
	<li>The hub is activated by contacting with drone by sending electromagneting wave which can throw away someone close to cross borders</li>
	<li>The closer penetrator gets to the center of this hub the farer away it will be thrown</li>
	<li>The hub need some time to be recharged before it can be activated again</li>
	<li>The game is started with some amount of scores matching the amount of potential penetrators circling around the base outside the border</li>
	<li>For each penetrator that made it to the base score is decreasing</li>
	<li>The challenge is to observe the situation and react, letting penetrator closer to hub to push it farther away, but, only if there is no another one closing to border</li>

	<li>Over the time some kiosks are randomly getting broken</li>
	<li>Fixing drone need to approach broken kiosk to fix it</li>
	<li>Fixing kiosk take some time, so drone need to be around the kiosk until it fully fixed</li>
